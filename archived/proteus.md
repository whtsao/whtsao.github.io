Proteus is a Python package for solving partial differential
equations. It has been developed and used for over ten years to solve
model equations arising in coastal and hydrualic engineering and to
conduct research on a wide range of computational methods for science
and engineering. Read more about it on the proteus documentation
website or explore the source code on github.
