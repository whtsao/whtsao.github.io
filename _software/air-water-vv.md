Computational models of multiphase flow, particularly air and water
flow, are important for coastal and riverine
engineering. Demonstrating that a computational model is "correct"
requires demonstrating that the numerical model converges to the
solution of the two-phase flow model equations (verification) and that
such solutions are an accurate approximation of reality
(validation). The Air-Water Verification and Validation repository
collects input files and descriptions for 2D and 3D verification and
validation.
