A Differential-Algebraic Equation (DAE) is a coupled system of
ordinary differential equations and algebraic constraint
equations. The Differential Algebraic Equation Toolkit (DAETK) is a
C++ library that implements some of the same algorithms as the Fortran
code
[DASPK](https://techtransfer.universityofcalifornia.edu/NCD/10326.html). It
was an early attempt at developing object-oriented mathematical
software in C++ and used [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc) to
support distribured parallel computation.
