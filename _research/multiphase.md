Many modeling problems in the near-surface environment involve
interactions among distinct material phases such as air and water or
water and sediment. There are a range of interesting open issues in
modeling multiphase flow for civil engineering applications, including
questions about correct constitutive relations and accurate
enforcement of physically correct jump conditions across phase
interfaces.
