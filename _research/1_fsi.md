Floating structures are just one type of problem where the fluid and
solid dynamics are tightly coupled to create a Fluid-Structure
Interaction (FSI) problem. We have been developing models that are
accurate and robust enough to use on coastal and riverine engineering
design and assessment, but many open challenges remain.
