---

We lead the development of physical and digital twins for agrivoltaic and floating solar farms, supporting long-term maintenance and monitoring systems. The focus is on developing models that are based on computational fluid and solid mechanics and ecological processes, which have a basis in the models used for understanding fluid-structure interaction in aerospace engineering, flooding in coastal engineering, and landscape evolution in ecology and agriculture. The models encompass a range of scales from water or air flow around a single panel or structural component to periodic arrays of panels over hundreds of acres of land or water.
