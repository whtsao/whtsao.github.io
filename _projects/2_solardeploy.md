We overse the implementation of numerical assessment and cost prediction for a pilot solar facility under storm and flooding threats. This project aims to evaluate multiple factors associated with designing, installing, and demonstrating solar farms in urban, open, or unused spaces. The project team consists of a broad range of expertise and partnered with BASF Corporation, proposes to examine the variables associated with site selection, land reuse, occupant behavior, energy demand, and weather-dependent energy production through a holistic approach.
