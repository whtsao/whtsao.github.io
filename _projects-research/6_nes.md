<p style="text-align: justify;">
Tuned mass dampers (TMDs) are a widely accepted control strategy for reducing wind-induced vibrations in tall buildings, enhancing structural safety and user comfort. Typically, these devices are tuned to match the vibration mode of the primary structure to attenuate its responses. However, under extreme transient loads, such as blast impacts or pulse-like earthquakes, the structure may exhibit inelastic behavior, causing shifts in its natural frequencies. This research focuses on the development and experimental validation of various nonlinear tuned mass dampers (NTMDs) designed to protect structures against such extreme transient loads.

The NTMDs developed in this study possess a unique capability to transfer energy from lower to higher frequencies through their nonlinear restoring force, thereby effectively mitigating the responses of the primary structure. Unlike traditional TMDs, these NTMDs do not rely on a specific frequency, avoiding the detuning effect during extreme loading conditions and maintaining their performance.

The research began with the development of a track NTMD, which consists of a cart moving along a track shaped by piecewise continuous curves, each represented by a continuous function. Numerical simulations and parametric studies have been completed, demonstrating that the first-order approximation method is both accurate and efficient. Optimal performance was achieved using a two-section track with polynomial coefficients of 1200 and 2000, respectively.
