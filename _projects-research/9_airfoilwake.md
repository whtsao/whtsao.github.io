<p style="text-align: justify;">
This research project investigates the two- and three-dimensional flow around airfoils, aiming to identify the wake position in a uniform flow over the airfoil. The flow is assumed to follow potential flow theory. The study begins by applying the Boundary Integral Equation (BIE) method to solve for the velocity potential on the airfoil's boundary. Once the velocity potential is determined, it is used in the BIE to calculate the flow field's velocity potential at specified points. To locate the wake, a cubic spline curve is employed to find points where the normal velocity components are zero. The study uses both Joukowski and NACA airfoils as test cases to validate the method.
