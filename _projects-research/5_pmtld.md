<p style="text-align: justify;">
This research project introduces the development of the "Porous-Media Tuned Liquid Damper (PMTLD)" as an innovative, eco-friendly, cost-effective passive vibration absorber applicable to structures such as buildings, ships, and offshore platforms. The PMTLD consists of a water tank containing porous media that enhances resistance to liquid motion, thereby increasing damping and improving vibration control. The project explores several key aspects: the derivation of mathematical formulations for liquid sloshing, supplementary solutions for free-surface motion, and the establishment of a linear equivalent mechanical model. Additionally, the study investigates the dynamic characteristics and modal behavior of sloshing within porous media. Experimental validation using impulsive and harmonic tests confirms the analytical methods. The research further examines the nonlinear damping effects and develops empirical formulas, culminating in an optimization design strategy for PMTLDs, demonstrated through various examples. This project provides a foundational study of the PMTLD's linear and nonlinear dynamics, highlighting its significant potential for future research.
