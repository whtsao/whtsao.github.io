<p style="text-align: justify;">
This research project introduces a novel boundary integral method (BIM) for analyzing two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear sloshing problems. The method employs a regularized boundary integral approach, utilizing a subtracting and adding-back technique to effectively handle the integrals of singularities and near-singularities in the boundary integral equation (BIE). Unlike the boundary element method (BEM), this BIM approach is simpler and more straightforward, providing not only accurate predictions of nonlinear free surface oscillations but also demonstrating excellent computational efficiency.

To validate the numerical methods, several small-scale model tests are conducted on a shaking table, simulating both harmonic and earthquake excitations. An artificial damping coefficient is introduced to account for energy dissipation in the liquid motion. By comparing experimental results with the numerical simulations, the study confirms that this BIM approach is more reliable, efficient, and practical for nonlinear sloshing simulations.
