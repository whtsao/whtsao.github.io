<p style="text-align: justify;">
This research project focuses on solving three-dimensional potential flow problems using a regularized boundary integral equation method. The boundary integral equation is regularized through a subtracting and adding-back technique applied to global elements, which employs various identities to eliminate the singularities and near-singularities in surface integrals.

In the test cases, the method demonstrates a convergence speed of the order N<sup>-3</sup> in one direction, regardless of the high-order quadrature applied, when dealing with smooth bodies. To verify the effectiveness of this method for nearly singular integrals, several highly oblate spheroids are tested, showing that the approach can significantly mitigate the nearly singular deficits. For non-smooth bodies, the method is used to solve mixed boundary value problems in sloshing motions within different vessel types. Finally, comparisons are made between traditional boundary element methods (local elements) and this new approach (global elements), highlighting the advantages of the regularized technique in improving computational accuracy and efficiency.
