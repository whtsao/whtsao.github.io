<p style="text-align: justify;">
Floating structures are just one type of problem where the fluid and solid dynamics are tightly coupled to create a Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problem. We have been developing models that are accurate and robust enough to use on coastal, marine, and offshore engineering design and assessment, but many open challenges remain. Major focus on: floater mooring analysis, floating wind turbines, ship maneuvering and stability, and resulting wake/scour/vortex shedding effects.
