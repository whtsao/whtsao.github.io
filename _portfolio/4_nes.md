<p style="text-align: justify;">
When a structure is subjected to extreme transient loading, such as blast loading or earthquakes, its inelastic behavior can result in a shift of its natural frequency. This frequency shift can render conventional mass dampers ineffective, as their tuning condition is disabled. To address this issue, nonlinear tuned mass dampers (NTMDs) have been developed. NTMDs do not rely on a specific frequency, which means they do not suffer from detuning effects when the primary structure experiences extreme transient loading. This characteristic allows NTMDs to maintain performance when the primary structure has changed their characteristics. This research focuses on a type of NTMD that consists of a cart moving on a track formed by continuous curves. Each curve is represented by a continuous function, enabling the NTMD to adapt and function effectively even under severe loading scenarios.
