We developed advanced simulation tools for both land-based and water-based solar farms. These tools will use detailed physics-based models to understand how solar panels interact with wind, water, vegetation, and soil. The goal is to create accurate simulations that can predict the behavior of solar panels from small, individual units to large, commercial installations. We The use site-specific data to create "digital twins" of real solar farms. These digital twins can simulate and forecast how solar farms will perform under various conditions, helping to manage risks such as flooding, storms, and landscape changes. We focus on four main areas to improve the design, deployment, and maintenance of solar farms: (1) Computational Methods and Modeling: Developing advanced simulations to study the interactions between solar panels and their environment; (2) Solar Farm Assessment: Evaluating the impact of solar panels on groundwater, vegetation, and stability under extreme weather; (3) Collaboration with Industry: Working with companies like BASF and Entergy to apply these simulations to real-world projects. The goal is to support clean energy development in low-sustanable  areas and beyond, contributing to global resiliency.
