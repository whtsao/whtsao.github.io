<p style="text-align: justify;">
Floating structures are just one type of problem where the fluid and solid dynamics are tightly coupled to create a Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problem. We have been developing models that are accurate and robust enough to use on coastal and riverine engineering design and assessment, but many open challenges remain.
