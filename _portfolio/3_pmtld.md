The tuned liquid damper filled with porous media is developed to promote an additional damping force for the conventional liquid dampers. According to Darcy's law, the permeability of porous media and liquid viscosity form a damping force linearly proportional to fluid velocity. The equivalent mechanical models considering the damping due to porous media in are established. In contrast to the other operating TLDs with damping devices, the natural frequency and damping ratio of TLD in the present paper can be obtained without
using empirical formulas. The impulsive and harmonic experiments are carried out to investigate the sloshing frequencies and the linear and nonlinear damping of sloshing liquid in a rectangular tank occupied by porous media. As the oscillatory responses remain linear in the impulsive-excitation tests, the damping ratios are obtained by the freevibration decay method. The analytical method, which is an equivalent mechanical model based on Darcyâ€™s law, is developed for comparison. As the dynamic responses become nonlinear in the harmonic excitations, the relationships between the sloshing force and the ground displacement are constructed and the damping ratio is determined by the resonance energy loss method. The relationships between the equivalent damping ratio, wave amplitude, and ground displacement amplitude for the large-excitation cases are established to justify the nonlinear damping effect. A modified mechanical model with a nonlinear damping mechanism is provided.
