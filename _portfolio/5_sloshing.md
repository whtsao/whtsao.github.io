A new boundary integral method (BIM) is employed in this paper to study the two-dimensional (2D) and the three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear sloshing problems. Applying the subtracting and adding-back technique by regularized boundary integral method, the integrals of singularity and near-singularity in the boundary integral equation (BIE) can be removed and replaced appropriately by the alternative terms, respectively. In contrast to boundary element method (BEM), BIM is simpler and more straightforward. Therefore, BIM can not only provide an accurate prediction of the nonlinear free surface oscillation, but also demonstrate the excellent efficiency of numerical calculation.
Several small-scaled model tests on a shaking table, including harmonic and earthquake excitations, are carried out to verify the numerical methods. An artificial damping coefficient is introduced to simulate the energy dissipation of liquid motion. By comparison of the experimental and numerical results, BIM will be more reliable, efficient and practical for nonlinear sloshing simulation.
