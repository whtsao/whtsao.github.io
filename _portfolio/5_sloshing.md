A new boundary integral method is employed to solve the 2D and 3D nonlinear sloshing problems. Applying the subtracting and adding-back technique by regularized boundary integral method, the integrals of singularity and near-singularity in the boundary integral equation can be removed and replaced appropriately by the alternative terms, respectively. This appoach is more straightforward compared to traditional boundary element method. Therefore, it is accurate and efficient for nonlinear free-surface flow simulation.
Several small-scaled model tests on a shaking table, including harmonic and earthquake excitations, are carried out to verify the numerical methods. An artificial damping coefficient is introduced to simulate the energy dissipation of liquid motion. By comparison of the experimental and numerical results, BIM will be more reliable, efficient and practical for nonlinear sloshing simulation.
