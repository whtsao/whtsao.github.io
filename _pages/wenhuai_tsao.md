I am an Coastal Marine Designer in [COWI](https://www.cowi.com/focus/north-america/). I have experience from both academic institutions and engineering company, with a wide range from small-scale projects of numerical/experimental structural dynamics and hydrodynamics analysis to multi-million coastal ecosystem design, mooring analysis, and offshore renewable energy project development. I see myself as a Specialist in structural, coastal, and marine systems design, a digital-twin Modeler, and a research/engineering Coach.

I was born in Taipei, Taiwan. I received my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering in 2009 and my Ph.D. in Structural Engineering in 2018, both from National Taiwan University. After completing a post-doc at NTU for one and a half years, I worked at [Ocean Engineering Group](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/research/research-areas/ocean-engineering) at UT Austin for two years and [Coastal Ecosystem Design Studio](https://www.lsu.edu/ceds/index.php) at LSU for three years. In June 2024, I joined COWI.

I love taking on projects that spark inspiration and creativity. Whether it's coding for data analysis, building automated systems, or doing some hands-on crafting. I love sports. I am a volunteer coach for youth basketball.
