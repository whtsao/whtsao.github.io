<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a Coastal Marine Designer at <a href="https://www.cowi.com/north-america/" target="_blank">COWI</a> with a diverse background encompassing both academic institutions and engineering companies. My expertise ranges from small-scale projects involving numerical simulations and experimental verification/validation of structural and hydro-dynamics to multi-million dollar projects on coastal ecosystem design, floater and mooring system dynamic analysis, and offshore renewable energy development. I consider myself a <strong>Specialist</strong> in structural, coastal, and marine systems design, a digital-twin <strong>Modeler</strong>, and a research/engineering <strong>Coach</strong>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I was born in Taipei, Taiwan. I received my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering in 2009 and my Ph.D. in Structural Engineering in 2018, both from National Taiwan University. After completing a post-doc at NTU for one and a half years, I worked at <a href="https://www.caee.utexas.edu/research/research-areas/ocean-engineering" target="_blank">Ocean Engineering Group</a> at UT Austin for two years and at <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/ceds/index.php" target="_blank">Coastal Ecosystem Design Studio</a> at LSU for three years. In June 2024, I joined COWI.
